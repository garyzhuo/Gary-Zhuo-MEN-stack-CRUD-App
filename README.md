User Stories
As a coffee drinker, espresso connoisseur I want to be able to help my other fellow espresso enthusiast explore and experience variety of espressos, all in one place.

I want this site to have coffee/ espresso around the world, featured in a website where they can easily browser and read thru the various types of espressos and ultimately choose their new favorites.

This site should reduce the searching and reduce the time a user takes to browse and find new espressos to try, this site should ultimateIy end the users search and rely solely on this site to provide the adequate information they need to stop going around the store and reading every label and ending their hour(s) long search online to find the right brand of espresso for them.
